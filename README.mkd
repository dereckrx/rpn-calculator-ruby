Implementation of an *extensible* four-function RPN calculator. The four functions are:
* plus
* minus
* times
* divide

Extensible means it's easy to add new operators. To add a new operation, simply add a new operation class into 'lib/operations' with the 'call' method and the 'key' constant defined. The operation class will be auto loaded and available for use. 

The code is command-line only, but GUI code can be substituted for the command-line interface. 

An example (using > as a prompt):
 
	$ calc
	> 4 3 +
	7
	> 100 100 + 2 *
	400
	> 

RPN is short for reverse-polish-notation (the same scheme used by HP calculators and by the Forth programming language). The idea is that numbers are placed on a stack and operators operate on the stack. So:

* 4 would push 4 onto the stack.
* 3 would then push 3 onto the stack (so the stack has 4 and 3 on it, with 3 on top
* + would remove the top two stack entries from the stack, add them together and put the result on the stack (so the stack would now have 7 on it).
